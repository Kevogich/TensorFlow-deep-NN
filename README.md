# TensorFlow-deep-NN

#### A high-level tutorial into Deep Learning using MNIST data and TensorFlow library 
**Prerequisites :**
* Fundamental coding skills - learn 
* Linear algebra, especially matrix operations
* Understanding how images are stored in computer memory.

Feel free to fork and adjust CONSTANTS to tweak network behaviour and explore how it changes algorithm performance and accuracy. Besides **TensorFlow graph** section can also be modified for learning purposes. It is highly recommended printing every variable that isnâ€™t 100% clear for you. 

Also, [tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html) can be used on a local environment for visualisation and debugging.
