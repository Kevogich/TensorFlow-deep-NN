# TensorFlow-deep-NN

#### A high-level tutorial into Deep Learning using MNIST data and TensorFlow library.\nby [@kakauandme](https://twitter.com/KaKaUandME) and [@thekoshkina](https://twitter.com/thekoshkina)\n\nAccuracy: 0.99\n\n**Prerequisites:** fundamental coding skills, a bit of linear algebra, especially matrix operations and perhaps understanding how images are stored in computer memory. To start with machine learning, we suggest [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng.\n\n\nNote: \n\n*Feel free to fork and adjust* CONSTANTS *to tweak network behaviour and explore how it changes algorithm performance and accuracy. Besides **TensorFlow graph** section can also be modified for learning purposes.*\n\n*It is highly recommended printing every variable that isnâ€™t 100% clear for you. Also, [tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html) can be used on a local environment for visualisation and debugging.*\n## Libraries and settings"
